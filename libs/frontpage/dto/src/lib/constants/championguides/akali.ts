export const AKALI: ChampionGuide = {
	strengths: `Both your Shuriken Flip E and Ultimate Perfect Execution R offer tons of outplay potential.
  You can often escape ganks or turn them around easily if you’re able to play it slow and wait for the perfect opportunity to fight or escape.
  Squishy champions will often be left alone, or they will walk around the map unaided.
  You can use this to your advantage to snowball and get more kills as Akali is a strong assassin and can kill squishy champions easily.
  If you’re able to get a few kills in lane, you can snowball quite quickly and further your lead.
  Try to abuse any slight advantage you get to increase your chances of winning the game.`,
	weaknesses: `Akali runs out of energy quite easily.
  You’ll need to keep a constant eye on your energy levels and only go in for aggressive plays when you have lots of energy.
  Akali and assassins like her struggle against teams with lots of CC.
  In team fights, you’ll have to wait for the perfect opportunity to go in so you do not get CC’d and killed pretty much instantly.
  Akali is one of the hardest champions to master in the game.
  Playing around her energy levels, her Passive, her Twilight Shroud W and her two mobility spells takes a lot of practice.
  Expect to put in a lot of effort if you want to learn Akali.`,
	gameplan: {
		early: `Focus on staying healthy and farming up till you gain access to your Twilight Shroud W, Shuriken Flip E, and Perfect Execution R.
    In the meantime, try to land your Five Point Strike Q on both the minion wave and the enemy champion.
    Since you use Energy, and your abilities are energy hungry, you should always take a look at your resource bar before attempting an all-in.
    Keep a track of the enemy Jungler from the beginning of the game as he will attempt to camp your lane till you hit level six.
    Use your Shuriken Flip E discretely in this lane as it allows you to both all-in and disengage against enemies.
    Your goal should be to get your first item as quickly as you can so that your all-ins become more potent and deadly.`,
		mid: `At this stage, your map awareness should be at its peak.
    You should always try to shove the wave with your Five Point Strike Q and try to roam towards any lane which has an extended laner.
    This will allow you to use your Shuriken Flip E and Ultimate Perfect Execution R to catch up to such extended targets, and get rid of them quickly.
    When you are fighting for a neutral objective and you manage to land an Shuriken Flip E on an enemy champion, you don't need to always go-in.
    This is because your presence, and the threat of your Shuriken Flip E, Twilight Shroud W, and Ultimate Perfect Execution R which automatically keeps the enemy carries away from you.
    This will ultimately result in the enemy team being zoned out.
    Proper usage of your Twilight Shroud W is very important during this stage of the game.
    If used freely, the enemy laner can bait you into such an all-in and then get rid of Akali quickly.
    Also, attempt to stay in a longer lane as it gives you more opportunities to all-in someone.`,
		late: `At this stage, teams will be closely grouped together so it’s unlikely you’ll be able to assassinate anyone. Continue to look for picks but expect there to be more than just 1 enemy nearby.
    It’s going to be difficult for you to 100 to 0 someone as many champions will be full build in the late game or at least have defensive tools like Zhonya’s Hourglass or Guardian Angel available to them.
    Continue to play team fights slow. While your cooldowns will be short, you need to play around your Twilight Shroud W as much as possible to ensure you can kill the enemy.`,

	powerspikes: {
		early: `After Akali has picked up her first component item, the damage output from her Five Point Strike Q will increase dramatically.
    Look to trade more often after your first back.
    Once you have access to all your basic abilities, you can start to trade more effectively with the enemy.
    At level 3, you can look for more aggressive plays, but don’t over commit to them, so you don’t fall behind.
    At level 6, Akali can look for aggressive all-ins as her Ultimate Perfect Execution R offers her a lot of additional kill pressure.
    Look for kills with your Ultimate Perfect Execution R when the enemy overextends.`,
		mid: `At level 9, Akali would’ve maxed out her Five Point Strike Q.
    At this stage of the game, she will be able to clear waves quickly and 1v1 most champions if they try to stop her from farming in a side lane.
    Once Akali hits level 11, she will have 2 points in her Ultimate Perfect Execution R.
    She can look for more aggressive plays and try to assassinate targets that are isolated or walking around the map on their own.
    Since Akali is an Assassin, she should have a few items completed during the mid-game.
    If you’re able to catch somebody out who is alone, it could easily result in a potential call for the Baron.`,
		late: `At level 16, Akali will have 3 points in her Ultimate Perfect Execution R. She will be able to dish out a lot of damage to anyone she comes into contact with.
    Your Ultimate Perfect Execution R will also be on a lower cooldown, which is very beneficial.
    At this stage of the game, Akali would be near max build. Landing an Shuriken Flip E on a squishy enemy champion should result in an easy kill.
    This kill could result in either the Baron or a favourable forced 5v4 fight.
    Akali does fall off in the later parts of the game as teams start to group. Akali is at her strongest in split fights or picks rather than straight 5v5s.
    Also, the enemy should start buying defensive items, which will make it harder for her to take them down.`,
