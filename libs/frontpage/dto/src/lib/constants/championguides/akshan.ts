export const AKSHAN: ChampionGuide = {
	strengths: `Akshan has tons of mobility thanks to his Heroic Swing E. It can allow him to move around the lane with ease, and get on to the enemy laner quickly.
  Akshan can bring back his dead allies if he can kill the enemy who killed them. This is great, especially in the later stages of the game where death timers are quite long.
  His Going Rogue W allows him to get out of sticky situations and allow him to be camouflaged for a long period of time if he stays near a wall.`,
	weaknesses: `Akshan doesn’t do too well into ranged matchups and champs with easy to land CC as he will be unable to use his Heroic Swing E aggressively.
  His Ultimate ComeuppanceR can be interrupted pretty easily. You have to be very careful when trying to use it otherwise the enemy will cancel its channel.
  Versus poke or champions with a lot of wave clear, it is going to be near impossible for you to roam and help your allies as the enemy will keep you pushed in or take your tower while you’re roaming.`,
	gameplan: {
		early: `The early game should be mainly focused on taking short trades against the enemy with your auto-attacks and Passive.
    Do not go for an extended trade unless the enemy's primary ability is on cooldown.
    If you manage to shove the wave in, try to roam with your Going Rogue W.
    If it so happens that the enemy side laners are low, you can quickly Heroic Swing E in and get some kills.
    Your Ultimate Comeuppance R will help you a lot in this game but make sure that you position correctly.
    Remember that you can use the ability while you're Heroic Swing E'ing, so ensure that you don't just stand still while it is locking up. `,
		mid: `During the middle game, make sure you are not ADC'ing consistently.
    Clean up kills when possible but don't get too close to CC heavy champs else, you will definitely get killed.
    Use your Heroic Swing E carefully in this phase of the game.
    The goal is to ensure that you never get caught off-guard by a skill shot that has the potential to CC you.
    Your Going Rogue W will come in very handy during this phase of the game.
    Stay in the backline and keep poking the enemies till your team all-ins them. Once the battle is done, go in for the cleanup kills. `,
		late: `This is the phase of the game where you will be dealing a ton of damage.
    You can use your Heroic Swing E more liberally to get some kills from now on.
    Your Ultimate Comeuppance R will be on a short cooldown, so ensure that you use it quite frequently.
    It will definitely help you with chunking out enemies who have already taken some damage.
    If you have allies who have CC built into their kit, try to stick near them. You should always focus on the CC'd target and kill them when you get a chance.
    Also, if the enemy has an assassin, try to shadow them and see if you can get the kill on them if they assassinate your allies.`,

	powerspikes: {
		early: `Akshan can look for an early aggressive play once he unlocks both his Avengerang Q and his Heroic Swing E.
    He can look for an aggressive play if he has been able to bully the enemy down at level 1.
    One Akshan has backed and picked up his first component item, his damage output and ability to trade increases.
    He should look for aggressive plays once he has brought his first component item.
    Level 6 is good for Akshan. This is because he unlocks his Ultimate Comeuppance R. It can help him secure kills and execute the enemy laner.`,
		mid: `At level 9, Akshan will max out his Avengerang Q. This is really important for Akshan as maxing his Avengerang Q offers him a lot of extra damage.
    When Akshan puts the second point in his Ultimate Comeuppance R at level 11, he will find it quite easy to execute enemies.
    At this stage of the game, teams will be grouping. Akshan’s Going Rogue W will be really good at this stage of the game because he can bring back a recently deceased ally.`,
		late: `Putting the third and final point in Akshan’s Ultimate Comeuppance R at level 16 is really beneficial for him.
    In the late game, depending on his items, he may be able to dish out tons of damage to a squishy target.
    At level 13, Akshan will max out his Heroic Swing E. The additional mobility is very powerful in the later stages of the game.
    Once again, as teams will be grouping in the late game, if he can get the shut down on a marked enemy, he can bring an ally back to life which could turn the tide of the game.`,
